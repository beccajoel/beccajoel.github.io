	<h3>DIY or die!</h3>
	<p>
		So for this blog post I have decided to write about how fun, cheap, and easy
		DIY'ing can be. "DIY" stands for "Do It Yourself" and basically encompasses
		a whole spectrum of activities within the crafting realm. When I was younger I learned to knit, crochet, and sew, which are all skills that can be used for DIYing but DIY is not limited to that. Creating a DIY project can simply involve a pair of scissors, fabric, and glue, or hammer, wood, and nails. It is a very broad topic that really just allows people to be super creative with something they'd like to create.

		It's right around Halloween time such that creating a costume from scratch is very much on my mind. Growing up I almost never bought my costume from a Party City or pop up halloween stores because my mom and I would find ways to DIY them! Naturally some costumes needed accessories that were purchased but in general we'd look up some costumes for inspiration and then think about how we could use old t-shirts, yarn, boxes and so on to create the ideal costume. This was a cheaper alternative to buying a costume and also made it more fun because it was a more involved process.

		I have also made a lot of knitting and crochetting projects over the years including, blankets, scarves, beanies, gloves, and hair scrunchies. Growing up in a relatively cold environment it was always so nice to curl up with multiple homemade fuzzy blankets. I also enjoy making gifts for my friends because I think it seems more personal than simply buying someone something. One year for the holidays I made my group of girl friends matching pompom scarves in their favorite colors. When we graduated from high school I made my girl friends each two-tone frilly scarves in the colors of their colleges. I never really think about if any of the gifts I've made are used all the time or ever I just enjoy getting to make people things that are personalized and hope they appreciate the effort put in.
