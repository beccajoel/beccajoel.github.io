  <align-left><h3>About</h3></align-left>
  <p>I am a sophomore at the University of Southern California pursuing a degree in computer science.
  I am currently experimenting with html, javascript, and CSS in order to create this website.
  I will also be posting some of the cool projects I've created in and outside of the classroom.
  Be sure to checkout my adventure blog for cool pictures and possible recommendations for
  places to checkout!
</p>
<center><h4>Daily Life</h4></center>
  <p>When I'm at school, and not in class, I spend a lot of time studying outside
    normally in the engineering quad. I love the beauty
  </p>
  <align-right><h4>Hobbies</h4></align-right>
    <p> I have a variety of hobbies, including DIY/Crafting, Hiking, Spinning, singing, riding rollercoasters
      and coding! I first started knitting when I was very young and have been making
      scarves, blankets, and clothing ever since. This led me to start making other DIY
      creations including bracelets, jewlery, and miscellaneous accessories. I have featured some
      of my work on my DIY page.
    </p>
    <p> I am currently a Silk in the Trojan Marching Band, spinning and waving a
      six-foot metal pole while marching around football stadiums around the country!
      I have been in color guard since I was in eighth grade and have always loved performing.
      This has been an integral part of my college experience as it keeps me active,
      has taught me how to improve my time management, and provided me with a network
      of long-lasting highly motivated and enthusiastic friends! I have featured some of the amazing
      photography over the past few years on my photography page and blog!

    <center><h2>Tech Jewlery</h2><center>
      <p3> I was first inspired to create tech jewlery from a pair of resistor
        earrings my brother gave me a few years ago. I had misplaced them for
        a period of time and when I found them again I couldn't RESIST but
        wear them all the time. Basically, I wanted to combine my love for DIY
        and tech by creating a variety of tech jewlery. Please see my DIY section
        for more specific pictures!
      </p3>
    <center><h2> Website</h2></center>
    <p1>I have created this website from scratch helping refine my knowledge of integrating HTML, javascript, and CSS.
    I have had a ton of fun working on this because I love getting to personalize my work. Blending this with
    programming has made this a great learning and growing experience for me.</p1>
      <center><h2> Chameleon Scarf</h2></center>
    <p2> Using a wearable arduino, LEDs, conductive thread, and a sensor I created a scarf that could change colors based
      on what someone's wearing. I sewed the LEDs spaced out along a ribbon connected with conductive thread with the arduino
      and sensor at one end. I programmed the arduino to signal the sensor to flash three times before registering the color
      of what was on top of it. By doing this users are able to place a portion of what they're wearing on top of the sensor
      which then changes all of the LEDs to be that color. I then covered this base with cheese cloth to diffuse the light
      dispersion better and then encompassed it in a knit white scarf. Fluffy white scarf by day, Electric color coordinated
      accessory by night.</p2>
